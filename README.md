- Includes a Python script (`Appendix_A.py`) for reproducibility.

### 2. Appendix B: Reproducibility Protocol for Figure 2 â€” Astronomical Alignment Comparison
- Provides code for comparing azimuthal deviations across Giza monuments.
- Includes a Python script (`Appendix_B.py`) for generating Figure 2.

### 3. Appendix C: Hydrological Modelling and Geospatial Data
- Describes DEM analysis, flood simulation, and accessibility classification.

### 4. Appendix D: Engineering Simulation Protocol and Output Tables
- Presents slope and stability classification for megastructure transport.
- Includes a Python script (`Appendix_D.py`) for mechanical simulation.

### 5. Appendix E: Re-evaluating the Khafre Valley Temple as a Megalithic Dock; Limitations of Ritual-Centric Interpretations
- Argues for a functional reinterpretation of the Khafre Valley Temple.

### 6. Appendix F: Comparative Visual Evidence for Neolithic Symbolic Convergence
- Offers photographic and diagrammatic comparisons across Neolithic sites.

**Note**: For Appendices A, B, and D, the `.py` files are included for full reproducibility. These can be downloaded and executed to replicate the original results.
